Synopsis: The TTMDS is a self-contained standard developed to describe standard entities found on 
the 1:25,000 – 1:50,000 Taiwan topographic maps. Two types of entities can be found: real features 
(e.g., Hé (河)) and cartographic features (e.g., contour lines (等高線)). Each entity comes with 
a name in Mandarin and its approximation in English, entity code, classification code, and definition
(in Mandarin).
