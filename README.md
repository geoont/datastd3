Full name: Definition of terms in topographic map databases (基本地形圖資料庫專有名詞定義)

Source: http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~chgis/work/coding/feat_types_tw.htm

Synopsis: The Taiwan Topographic Map Data Sstandard (TTMDS), published by the Taiwan Ministry of the Interior, is a self-contained standard developed to describe standard entities found on 
the 1:25,000 – 1:50,000 Taiwan topographic maps. Two types of entities can be found: real features 
(e.g., Hé (河)) and cartographic features (e.g., contour lines (等高線)). Each entity comes with 
a name in Mandarin and its approximation in English, entity code, classification code, and definition.

Synopsis: The US SDTS of the US Geological Survey was designed to provide a means to transfer 
earth-reference spatial data between dissimilar computer systems. It is scale-independent and 
contains 200 mutually exclusive standard categories, which describe real-world features 
instead of those in the database schema or cartographic representations. The standard provides 
a definition expressed in natural language for each standard category.
