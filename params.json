{"name":"Datastd3","body":"datastd3\r\n========\r\n\r\nThe repository contains data describing the categories and hierarchies in TTMDS, RFK, and the US SDTS listed below. Each standard comes with a set of files, which include (1) a CSV file containing category names and codes in comma-delimited format, (2) a SOFT file describing the structure of categories in a data standard, (3) two GV files automatically generated from the SOFT file, one for hydrographic and the other for topographic categories, and the corresponding PDF files. These files serve the purpose of (1) understanding what are the categories in each standard, (2) understanding what are the organizing structure of a data standard, and (3) facilitating easy viewing and printing, respectively.\r\n\r\nFor more information an acces data file visit project repository at https://github.com/geoont/datastd3\r\n\r\nShortcuts to PDF diagrams:\r\n * SDTS\r\n  * [complete](https://github.com/geoont/datastd3/blob/master/SDTS.pdf)\r\n * TMOI\r\n  * [elevation](https://github.com/geoont/datastd3/blob/master/TMOI-elevation.pdf)\r\n  * [hydrography](https://github.com/geoont/datastd3/blob/master/TMOI-hydrography.pdf)\r\n * RFK\r\n  * [elevation](https://github.com/geoont/datastd3/blob/master/RFK-elevation.pdf)\r\n  * [hydrography](https://github.com/geoont/datastd3/blob/master/RFK-hydrography.pdf)\r\n","tagline":"Data files for three topographic standards","note":"Don't delete this file!
